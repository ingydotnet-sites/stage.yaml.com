This world-wide discussion happened on the XML-DEV mailing list, starting in 1997 and continuing until at least last Wednesday. In November 1999 a faction of that list started talking about SML, a simpler more minimal XML. They decided to create their own SML-DEV mailing list. It was there that Clark and Oren eventually decided to break away from angle brackets altogether and... YAML was born.</p> <p>At that time Ingy had landed a job in Open Source Heaven (aka ActiveState) and was sitting in a row of Perl programmers, across from a row of Python programmers. He was working on the Perl core's plain text serialization language, Data::Dumper. In the Spring of 2001, he must have caught some Python fever, because he made Data::Denter, an indentation based serialization language module for CPAN.</p> <p>In May, he got an email from Clark which led to an hours long phone call.

YAML 1.2 has not been changed.</li> <li>Hundreds of changes to improve clarity and readability and remove ambiguity.</li> <li>Syntax productions are revised to simplify the trickier parts.

Run <code>make serve</code> in your fork to see local changes.</li> </ul> <p>This revision is the result of years of work by the new YAML language development team.

We know that despite its large and growing popularity, the YAML ecosystem has many problems. We see the various ways that projects are trying to extend the language or work around its quirks. We see a future where YAML:</p> <ul> <li>Becomes richer and more expressive, while not breaking today's YAML.</li> <li>Achieves lossless data transfer between frameworks in any language.</li> <li>Has frameworks that offer full functionality, and yet are easier to write and   maintain.</li> </ul> <p>It's a tall order, but we've been working on it for years and we see the path forward. We're not only working out the ways to specify the future YAML, we are building working reference frameworks and tools in sync.

This glossary identifies the YAML terms and gives their meanings.</p> Term Definition Alias An alias is a reference or pointer to a node in the YAML graph that was annotated with an anchor. The alias <code>*foo</code> references the node with the anchor <code>&amp;foo</code>. Anchor An anchor is a name that is attached to a node with the syntax <code>&amp;name</code>. It allows the node to be referenced elsewhere in the document using the alias syntax. Block The term \"block\" is used to describe the YAML syntax form that uses indentation scoping. A YAML node can either be expressed in block form or flow form. Collection A node whose kind is either a mapping or a sequence. Directive A YAML syntax line that gives extra information to a parser. There are only 2 defined directives in YAML 1.2: \u2022 <code>%YAML 1.2</code> -- Indicates the YAML spec version that the stream conforms to\u2022 <code>%TAG !eg! tag:example.com,1999:</code> -- Expands short tags to fully qualified form Document A document is a top level node. A YAML file (stream) usually contains a single document; it may contain 0-n documents. DOM A YAML DOM is the theoretical or actual data structure that a YAML loader loads to and a YAML dumper dumps from. In some implementations it may be the final stage in the stack, and in others it is the stage below a native data structure. Dump/Dumper A dumper is the set of stack transformations that convert data from a program memory structure to YAML text. Explicit key The <code>?</code> explicit key indicator is used in block mappings to convey that the node that follows it is a mapping key. This is most commonly used for mapping keys that are collections. Flow The term flow is used to describe the YAML syntax form that uses <code>{}</code> and <code>[]</code> indicators for collection scoping. It is a proper superset of the JSON syntax. Flow nodes can appear inside of block nodes, but block nodes cannot appear inside of flow nodes. Folded scalar The folded syntax form is a block scalar indicated by <code>&gt;</code> syntax and is followed by text lines that are indented past the current level. The text lines are joined together according to rather complex rules. The general rule is that 2 adjacent, non-blank lines are joined by a single space. Analogous to HTML text folding. Framework A YAML implementation in a given programming language is called a framework. Kind YAML has 3 kinds of nodes: mapping, sequence and scalar. Literal scalar The literal block scalar form is used for multiline text. It begins with the <code>|</code> indicator. The text lines are indented past the current indentation level, but otherwise left as is. This is the best way to represent multiline plain text files in YAML. Load/Loader A loader is the set of stack transformations that convert data from YAML text to an in memory data structure. Mapping A mapping is a collection that consists of a set of 0 or more key/value pairs. In YAML, both the key and the value can be any kind of node. Native An in memory data structure that is implemented natively by the programming language in use. YAML frameworks usually load data from text to native, and dump data from native to text. Node This is the term to describe any individual collection or scalar in a YAML document, DOM or native structure. Plain scalar An unquoted text value in a YAML document. Plain scalars are assigned tags by analysis of their textual value content. Quoted scalar There are 4 methods of quoting scalars in YAML: single-quoted, double-quoted, literal and folded. Each method has its own syntax and semantics. The default tag for a quoted scalar is always <code>!!str</code>. Scalar A scalar is a node that consists of a single value unit. Strings, numbers and boolean values are examples of scalar nodes. Schema In YAML, the term schema refers to the various mechanisms that assign semantic meaning to YAML data. In YAML 1.2, this information is usually hardcoded into the various frameworks. Some frameworks allow YAML to be loaded using a few different named schemas. Additionally some frameworks support user hooks/overrides. Schema information can also be conveyed by the author of a YAML file, using tags.In the next version, YAML will define a schema language that will allow for custom and concise schema definitions that a YAML framework may use to process data. Sequence A sequence is a collection that is an ordered list of 0 or more nodes. Stack The YAML stack is the set of transformations that take YAML data from one form to another. There are 2 primary stacks. The load stack takes data from text to a native structure, and the dump stack takes data from a native structure to text. State The various defined forms that YAML data exists in within the stack. These include: <code>file encoding</code>, <code>character stream</code>, <code>textual lexemes</code>, <code>data tokens</code>, <code>YAML events</code>, <code>YAML DOM</code>, <code>native data</code>. Stream A YAML stream is the text of a YAML file. It contains directives, comments and documents. Tag Every node in a YAML document is assigned a tag by the load stack. The tag indicates how the data will be transformed into memory. Tags are mostly assigned implicitly, but the <code>!ns!tag</code> syntax can be used to set a node's tag explicitly. Transformation A process in the YAML Stack that converts data from one state to another. The transformations in the load stack consist of <code>read</code>, <code>scan</code>, <code>lex</code>, <code>parse</code>, <code>compose</code> and <code>construct</code>. The dump stack goes in parallel the other way: <code>deconstruct</code>, <code>decompose</code>, <code>emit</code>, <code>format</code>, <code>join</code> and <code>write</code>. Top-level In texts describing YAML text, nodes and processing, it is often necessary to qualify a node as being at the top level or not. For instance: \"A YAML document consists of a single, top-level node\"."},{"location":"resources/glossary/#see-also","title":"See Also","text":"<ul> <li>FAQ - Frequently asked questions</li> <li>Cheatsheet - Quick syntax reference</li> <li>YAML Specification - Official specification</li> </ul>"},{"location":"services/","title":"Services","text":"<p>The YAML Company provides professional support from YAML's creators.</p>"},{"location":"services/#why-the-yaml-company","title":"Why The YAML Company?","text":""},{"location":"services/#direct-access-to-creators","title":"Direct Access to Creators","text":"<p>Work directly with the co-creator of YAML and the maintainers of core YAML libraries.</p>"},{"location":"services/#unique-authority","title":"Unique Authority","text":"<p>We maintain the specification, core implementations, and have authority over YAML's future.</p>"},{"location":"services/#sustainable-model","title":"Sustainable Model","text":"<p>Your investment supports the long-term health of critical infrastructure.</p>"},{"location":"services/#the-yes-program","title":"The YES Program","text":"<p>Our primary offering is the YES (YAML Enterprise Sustainability) program\u2014enterprise support from the people who built YAML.</p> <p>Every YES member gets:</p> <ul> <li>48-hour early security notifications</li> <li>Professional support from YAML experts</li> <li>Strategic influence to help decide what YAML builds next</li> <li>Access to member forum and town halls</li> </ul> <p>Learn About YES Tiers &amp; Pricing \u2192</p>"},{"location":"services/#professional-services","title":"Professional Services","text":"<p>Available to YES members and as standalone engagements:</p> <ul> <li>Security - Audits, vulnerability assessments, and remediation planning</li> <li>Training - YAML fundamentals, advanced topics, and YAMLScript workshops</li> <li>Consulting - Architecture review, migration planning, performance optimization</li> <li>Custom Development - Sponsor features, library extensions, integration work</li> </ul> <p>YES members receive preferred pricing on all services.</p>"},{"location":"services/#who-we-serve","title":"Who We Serve","text":""},{"location":"services/#cloud-infrastructure-providers","title":"Cloud &amp; Infrastructure Providers","text":"<p>Companies providing platforms that depend on YAML:</p> <ul> <li>Kubernetes hosting and management</li> <li>CI/CD platform providers</li> <li>Cloud configuration services</li> </ul>"},{"location":"services/#devops-tool-companies","title":"DevOps Tool Companies","text":"<p>Companies building tools that use YAML:</p> <ul> <li>GitLab, GitHub, CircleCI, etc.</li> <li>HashiCorp and similar</li> <li>Configuration management platforms</li> </ul>"},{"location":"services/#large-enterprises","title":"Large Enterprises","text":"<p>Organizations with significant YAML deployments:</p> <ul> <li>Financial services</li> <li>Technology companies</li> <li>Telecommunications</li> <li>E-commerce platforms</li> </ul>"},{"location":"services/#get-started","title":"Get Started","text":"<p>Join the YES Program \u2192</p> <p>Contact Us \u2192</p>"},{"location":"yes/","title":"YES: YAML Enterprise Sustainability","text":""},{"location":"yes/#say-yes-to-yamls-future","title":"Say YES to YAML's future","text":"<p>YAML is the invisible backbone of modern infrastructure.
